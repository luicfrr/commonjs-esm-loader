## ðŸ“š Introduction

Trying to load a fresh installed package and got the error `cannot use import statement outside a module`? This packaged is the sollution for your problems.

I've created it after Googling a lot trying to find a sollution on how to import an ESM package in a big and consolidated CommonJS project... Migrate whole project to ESM architecture just to use a single package was not an option.

## ðŸ§° Installation

To install, you can use [npm](https://npmjs.org/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com):

```sh
npm install commonjs-esm-loader
# or
yarn add commonjs-esm-loader
```

## ðŸ’¡ Usage

OBS: Using [`pdfreader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pdfreader) package as example because it was the package that makes me create this project, but it works with any ESM package you want to load.

#### JavaScript
```javascript
import { importEsmModule } from 'commonjs-esm-loader'

async function myFunction() {
  const { PdfReader } = await importEsmModule( 'pdfreader' )
  // your package is loaded and ready to use :)
  new PdfReader( ... )
}
```

#### TypeScript
```javascript
import { importEsmModule } from 'commonjs-esm-loader'
// load package type so intellisense can work
import type PdfReaderType from 'pdfreader'

async function myFunction() {
  const { PdfReader } = await importEsmModule<typeof PdfReaderType>( 'pdfreader' )
  // your package is loaded, typed and ready to use :)
  new PdfReader( ... )
}
```

## ðŸ‘· Built With
